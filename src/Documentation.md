For this Java project 2 the steps that I took to complete this project are the following.
The first thing that I did was analyze the code after I downloaded it from Zybooks.
I looked through each class and see what needs to be done. 
The main and the station was done so I only look through it to see what was being passed and what variables and method were in each class. 
Then I went to the main class to see what was missing and let eclipse autofill it in to the right class. 
Then I went to the inherited class to add that it inherited from the abstract class. 
Then I added in the constructor that was need and the variable that goes with it. 
Then I went online to an online IDE and did my test coding there to see if what I was thing of will work. 
I had it simple as I had a string like the example to see if the result will match as if it did not, I knew immediately that there is something wrong with the code.
Then I created a for loop to and just add one of the characters to and integer to see if the was right as I printed it out.
Then I changed it to an integer array and added the values to it. 
Then I went to eclipse and pasted what I had under the integer array method.
Then I had to figure out how to add the values in the array. 
The best way that I thought of was to create a new variable and a for loop to loop though the 4 values and add it to the new variable. 
I did the test and it did add up correctly. 
Then I went to eclipse and pasted what I had under the integer array method.
Then I did the average with using the sum and using the length of the string as what need to be divided by.
Then I did the ceil and floor and printed it out to see if it will do it correctly with the average. 
When it printed it out it was double so I had to cast it to an integer so that it will match the output.
Then I try to add to the array with the ceil and floor.
I printed out the index to where it was added to see if it was correct.
Then I went to eclipse and pasted what I had under the integer array method.
So then that last part is the compare if it is greater or less than 0.5 as if it needs to be rounded up or down. 
So, then the best method for that was to find what the decimal is my subtracting the average from the floor value. 
This will get me the decimal value and I can use an if statement to compare it if it is greater than or less than 0.5.  
Then I added into the array and printed it out to see if it was correct. 
Then I went to eclipse and pasted what I had under the integer array method.
As the last I need to figure out how to convert the integer to a character. 
I went to google to figure out what the syntax was, and it would as be expected as I pulled the number from what it was on the last input from the array.
Then I went to eclipse and pasted what I had under the character method.
Then I went to work on the abstract method. 
At first, I was unsure what it wanted until I went to look at our lab 6 example and abstract class.
I added a constructor and abstract method with no return. 
I ran the program to see if it will still work.
Then I went around and cleaning up the code. 
I submitted on Zybook as it was complete, and the output was what it wanted. 
This is what I did for this Java project 2.
The thing that help me the most was working in another test environment to see if the concept will work and how it will work. 
The only error that I got was a null point exception on the size of the array. 
I just set the array size to 4 as that was the only number that did not give me out of bound or null pointer. 
As I was finishing up, I went back and check what I have done and how I can clean it up to make it look better in the end by combing or deleting code that I do no need. 
This project was a great continuing from the last project.
I cannot wait for the next project.
